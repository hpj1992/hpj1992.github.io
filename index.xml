      <description>In The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers, legendary software expert Robert C. Martin introduces the disciplines, techniques, tools, and practices of true software craftsmanship. This book is packed with practical adviceâ€“about everything from estimating and coding to refactoring and testing. It covers much more than technique: It is about attitude.
In this article, I have tried to summarize key insights from the book, carefully picking key advices from each chapter.</description>
